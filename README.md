Blipstick is a simple addon to change the minimap blip textures. I wrote it
because I didn't like the big huge '!' and '?' Blizzard used, so I adjusted the
sizes a bit. Since then I've added in blips from other addons and created a
config panel so the user can select the set of blips they like.

New blip textures are always welcome, send a pull request on GitHub.
